To install the package you usually just type

    perl Makefile.PL
    make               # optional
    make test          # optional
    make install

During the first step you will be asked some questions. First of all,
you have to decide, which database engines you want to be supported
by entering one of the numbers 1 (Mysql only), 2 (mSQL only) or 3
(both).

Once this is done, for any DBMS you´ll be asked in which directory the
respective API libraries and headerfiles are installed. You can avoid
this question by setting the MSQL_HOME and MYSQL_HOME environment
variables. If, for example, the file $MSQL_HOME/include/msql.h exists,
you will not be prompted for the installation directory.

Please let us know, if you have further questions that should be dealt
with in this document.

Enjoy,
