xtract			Script to create files from dbd/ and nodbd/
lib/Bundle/Mysql.pm     These are only distributed because PAUSE needs
lib/Bundle/Msql.pm      the .pm files being present. Instead modify the
lib/Mysql.pm            corresponding files in the dbd and nodbd directories.
lib/Mysql/Statement.pm  They are automatically regenerated using "xtract".
