To install the package you usually just type

    perl Makefile.PL
    make               # optional
    make test          # optional
    make install

During the first step you will be asked some questions. First of all,
you have to decide, which database engines you want to be supported:
MySQL or mSQL (any or both of mSQL1 and mSQL2).

If you install the mSQL driver, but not for both of mSQL1 or mSQL2,
the perl modules will be named DBD::mSQL and Msql. If you install
both of mSQL1 and mSQL2, the drivers will be named DBD::mSQL and
Msql (mSQL2) or DBD::mSQL1 and Msql1, respectively.

Once this is done, for any DBMS you'll be asked in which directory the
respective API libraries and headerfiles are installed. You can avoid
this question by setting the MSQL_HOME and MYSQL_HOME environment
variables. If, for example, the file $MSQL_HOME/include/msql.h exists,
you will not be prompted for the installation directory.

If "make test" fails with a message like

	Cannot connect: Can't connect to local mSQL server
        Either your server is not up and running or you have no
        permissions for acessing the DSN DBI:mSQL:test.
        This test requires a running server and write permissions.
        Please make sure your server is running and you have
        permissions, then retry.

this can have a number of possible reasons:

  - your database engine is not up and running
  - you don't have a database "test"; either create one or try setting
    the environment variable DBI_DSN to the correct value:

	DBI_DSN="DBI:mSQL:mydb"; export DBI_DSN		# Bourne-Shell
	setenv DBI_DSN="DBI:mSQL:mydb"			# C-Shell

  - your engine is not running on the local host; fix this by by adding
    the host name and port to DBI_DSN, for example

	DBI_DSN="DBI:mSQL:test:hostname=localhost:port=3333"

Please let us know, if you have further questions that should be dealt
with in this document.
